 *
 * The protcol defines the packet format, message types, and message
 * exchange sequence for data exchange between producer and consumer devices.
 * The data is independendt words of 16-bit long compined in a message, which
 * is furthermore packed into a packet with header and trailer bytes. The purpose
 * is to synchronize the data flow and provide some level of flow control for
 * the communication.
 *
 * Communication start with the exchange of ACK messages between producer and
 * consumer. The producer transmits ACK packets until it receives a reply from
 * consumer. After that the producer starts transmitting data packets. The ACK
 * exchange occurs after each recovery from a communication failure.
 *
 * The module bases on the Xilinx's example in xuartps_intr_example.c-file.
